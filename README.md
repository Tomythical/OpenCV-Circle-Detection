## Project Aim
This project was undertaken as part of my Team Project Module in Durham University where my team and I provided solutions for the pressure-sensing solutions company 
Peratech. Our objective was to find a way to quantify the performance of the smoothing algorithm Peratech had developed from the test data they provided. 
This consisted of detecting and measuring the differences between the output of the tracking algorithm and the input test pattern.

## My Role
I was in charge of developing a method to quantify the inaccuracy of images of circles given to me.
